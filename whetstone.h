 *
 * Converted by Rich Painter, Painter Engineering, Inc. based on the
 * www.netlib.org benchmark/whetstoned version obtained 16 March 1998.
 *
 * A novel approach was used here to keep the look and feel of the
 * FORTRAN version.  Altering the FORTRAN-based array indices,
 * starting at element 1, to start at element 0 for C, would require
 * numerous changes, including decrementing the variable indices by 1.
 * Instead, the array E1[] was declared 1 element larger in C.  This
 * allows the FORTRAN index range to function without any literal or
 * variable indices changes.  The array element E1[0] is simply never
 * used and does not alter the benchmark results.
 *
 * The major FORTRAN comment blocks were retained to minimize
 * differences between versions.  Modules N5 and N12, like in the
 * FORTRAN version, have been eliminated here.
 *
 * An optional command-line argument has been provided [-c] to
 * offer continuous repetition of the entire benchmark.
 * An optional argument for setting an alternate LOOP count is also
 * provided.  Define PRINTOUT to cause the POUT() function to print
 * outputs at various stages.  Final timing measurements should be
 * made with the PRINTOUT undefined.
